<h2>Space Math</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
When I was 4 I was scared of space, and I liked educational games, so this is an educational game where you fight enemies from space.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to learn while playing this game, and I want them to be engaged in the story through level progression.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This is an educational game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
When the game starts enemies will begin to spawn. You must click on an enemy to target it and then answer a math problem using the number keys on your keyboard. A correct answer will defeat the enemy, an incorrect one will play a sound, and then give a new problem. Problems will start with basic addition, then will get more difficult and use other operations.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This prototype is testing health, story progression through stages, and basic addition, where the sum is less than 10.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Learn Math: Progression is based on math. Defeat Aliens: Game includes a variety of unique enemy types.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
An alien fleet is approaching the earth. You are the captain of the U.S.S. Addition, which has been tasked with stopping the invasion.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You are the captain of the U.S.S. Addition. You have been tasked with stopping an alien fleet from invading the earth. During launch your targeting system was damaged, so if you want to hit a target you'll have to perform the calculations yourself.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is targed at ages 4+.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Gameplay takes around 30 minutes. Prototype gameplay takes around 4 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Think through the problem. Pressing the wrong answer will make you wait for a new problem to be given. If you fail to click on an enemy in time and another has appeared, take the damage and switch targets.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Prototype sprites created from scratch. Background image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope (http://hubblesite.org/gallery/). Stage 1 and 2 Music: Touhou 13 OST - Let's live in a lovely cemetary by ZUN. Stage 3 Music: Touhou 14 OST - Reverse Ideology by ZUN.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game was inspired by a game I played when I was 4 called Troggle Trouble Math, which used a similar answer a math problem to defeat an enemy mechanic.
